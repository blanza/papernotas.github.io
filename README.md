Abstract

Brazil experienced changes in the composition of the workforce by age-education groups and distribution between the formal and informal sectors from 1980 to 2010. We estimate whether these area-level compositions reduced yet further the earnings of the least-educated individuals. Our main hypothesis is that earnings are lower for those living in areas where higher proportions of workers are less educated and employed in the informal sector. Ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions carried out on census data are used to estimate variations in the individual earnings of male workers living in urban areas, including several individual- and area-level independent variables. The main results suggest that an increase in the proportion of formal sector workers is positively associated with individual earnings. Higher group proportions have the strongest positive associations with individual earnings for formal sector workers with secondary and university education. Labour markets are not absorbing the least educated workers. The largest earnings differentials by education level are observed among workers in the informal sector, which is evidence of greater economic inequality within this sector.
