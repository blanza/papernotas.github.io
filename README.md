Abstract

Brazil experienced variations in the composition of workers by age-education groups, as well as
by formal and informal sectors between 1980 and 2010. We estimate if these area-level
compositions reduced even further earnings of least-educated individuals. Our main
hypothesis assesses that earnings are lower for those living in areas with higher proportions
of workers with lower education and in the informal sector. Ordinary least squares regressions
estimate variations on individual earnings of male workers living in urban areas using census
data, including several individual- and area-level independent variables. Main results
suggest that higher proportions of workers in the formal sector have positive associations with
individual earnings. Higher group proportions generate stronger positive associations with
individual earnings for workers with secondary and university education in the formal sector.
Labor markets are not absorbing the least educated workers . Stronger differentials across
earnings by education are observed among workers in the informal sector, which is evidence of
greater economic inequality within this sector.
